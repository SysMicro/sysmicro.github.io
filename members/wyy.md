Yuanyi Wu joined the BMA lab as a research assistant in June 2021 shortly after her graduation in MSc. Ecological Applications from Imperial College London. She is excited at revealing the critical role of tiny but ubiquitous microorganisms in human health and ecosystem functioning. Particularly, she focuses on the responses of the microbial communities in PAHs-contaminated soil to antibiotics. She also seeks to understand the interactions between viruses and bacteria based on the experiments and the analysis of large-scale viral and microbial omics datasets. Moreover, she is currently collaborating with other professors, students, and staff at ZJU-Hangzhou Global Scientific and Technological Innovation Center and assisting in the BMA lab management.
