Xinwei Song graduated from the Nanjing Agricultural University in June 2020. She majored in ecology as an undergraduate and was interested in soil microbes specifically. After she graduated, she was lucky enough to enter BMA lab and became a member of the research group. Her research project is bioremediation of soil composite pollution, and her main research content is the construction of ecological network of rhizosphere cooperative remediation of agricultural soil with combined pollution. Her final goal is to establish the rhizospheric interaction networks of plants-animals-microorganisms to accelerate the synergetic remediation of combined pollutants. Further, to find new methods to regulate the synergistic remediation in rhizosphere on combined pollutants in agricultural soils.
