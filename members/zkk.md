**We are turning the tide**

Kankan Zhao decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Soil Science after graduating from Zhejiang University with a degree of Bachelor of Agricultural Science in Agricultural Resources and Environment. His primary focus lies in using ecological theories and bioinformatics methods to reveal the interactions between rhizosphere microbial community members. Currently, he is exploring to apply time series analysis to unravel microbial community dynamics. He is also interested in soil viromes.
