## *Dr. Hao Ren*

\center
![](img/members/haoren.jpg)

Hao Ren graduated with a Ph.D. in microbiology from Zhejiang University in June 2021. During his Ph.D., his work mainly focused on the molecular mechanism of tetrahydrofuran (THF) degradation in Gram-negative bacteria. The research is of great significance to reveal the diversity of microbial degradation of THF and to further explore the evolutionary laws of THF-degrading gene clusters. He joined Maâ€™s lab as a postdoc in September 2021. Dr. Ren is broadly interested in many aspects of pollutant degradation, such as degradation pathway, explore functional genes from metagenomic sequencing data, and microbial interactions.
