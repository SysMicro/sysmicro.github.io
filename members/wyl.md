Yiling Wang holds a Agricultural Resources and Environment B.S.A. from the Zhejiang University. She is currently working on an exploration of the viromes in soil ecosystems. During the Ph.D study, her focus lies in the viral biogeography in global scale, and relationships between viruses and their prokaryotic hosts in soil to explore the dynamic variation of viral community structure and ascertain the complex interactions between viruses and prokaryotic hosts. Her end goal is to understand the ecological functions of viral community in soil ecosystems, increase the knowledge in biogeochemical cycle in soil ecosystems, and provide theoretical support for regulating ecological functions of soil ecosystems.
