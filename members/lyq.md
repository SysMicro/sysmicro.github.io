## Yiqun Li

I come from Taizhou and had graduated in land resource management. I feel lucky enough to be a member of BMA lab and hope that I can contribute to the cause of soil microorganism. For the reason of interest in the geographical distribution of soil Micro-organism, I decide to make great effort to the exploration of the wider and deeper Soil microecological world. Finally, I firmly believe that the harder you work, the luckier you are.
