## Postdoctoral fellow position to study engineering microbiome at Zhejiang University, China

We are seeking several postdoctoral fellows to develop innovative technlogyies for enginneering microbiome. This is funded by the Synthetic Biology Platform of the Hangzhou Innovation Centre. The postdoctoral fellow will be based at Zhejiang University and work under the supervision of Dr. Bin Ma, PI in the Hangzhou Innovation Centre, and Dr. Jianming Xu,  Professor of Zhejiang University. The successful candidate will lead the design, conduct, and analysis of engineering microbiome. The candidate will also participate in all aspects of the design and conduct of the development of engineering microbiome technologies.

### Positoin 1: Bacteria cultivation
The candidate is expected to familar with bacterial isolation and cultivation from soils, bacterial genome analysis, and co-culture experiment. Experience in IChip, flow cytometry, or database building will be preferential. The candidate will in charge wtih bacteral isolation and co-culture experiment with BioFoundry platform and microfuildic tools.   

### Position 2: Systems microbiology
The candidate is expected to familar with flux balance analysis and microbial interaction prediction with genomes. Experience in systems biology, gene network analysis, synthetic biology will be preferential. The candidate will in charge wtih development of  innovative method for microbiome designing algorithm based on system biology methods, such a network analysis of metabolic network.

### Position 3: Microfluidics
The candidate is expected to familar with microfuidics design and utilization. Experience in single cell isolution, microdrops will be preferential. The candidate will in charge wtih design microfluidics for synthetic microbiome building and testing. 

## Preferred qualifications and skills:
- PhD in one of the following areas: Microbiology, synthetic biology, system biology, microfluidic, and relevant area.
- Experience in study design. 
- Strong interest in engineering microbiome.
- Ability to collate and analyze data, interpret and present results to a high standard using a range of specialized research techniques.
- Good knowledge of R/Python.
- Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
- Ability to work independently but also as part of a larger interdisciplinary research team.

## Payments and benefits
  
This will be a two-year appointment with the possibility to extend, should both parties agree. The annual salary will be ~$65,000 with other benefits, including housing subsidy, free gym, and other benefits. 

## How to apply
