### Research Interests

#### Engineering Soil Microbiome
Mining and exploiting the microbiomes have crucial application potentials in soil nutrient utilization and plant health promotion. However, there is still a woeful shortage of precise design and validation systems in soil microbial research. The proposed project will design and assemble the functions of rice rhizosphere engineering microbiomes, aiming at sustainable development of agriculture, and will employ microbial complex networks and machine learning algorithms to achieve the directed regulation of rice rhizosphere engineering microbiome functions. Addressing the above scientific questions will provide a new framework for microbiome engineering and support the sustainable development of agriculture.

#### Systems Microbiology

Microbes wired with others through complex interactions. Systems biology provides a novel perspedctive for microbial ecology investigation that interaction networks of genes, proteins, microbes, and other factors in ecosystems play critical roles in regulating ecosystem functions. We are trying to explore the complex interactions in microbial communities by inferring microbial networks for genes, proteins, and microbes.

#### Rhizosphere Microbiomes

Rhizosphere microbiomes are essential for plant grwoth and health, and for ecosystem sustainability. However, our understanding in rhizosphere microbiomes is still unclear because of microbial "dark matters" and complex cross-talking between plant and rhizosphere microbiomes. We are digging microbial "dark matters" with FACS-iChip and are illustrating plant-microbe cross-talking mechanisms in rhizosphere with RhizoChip.


## Postdoctoral Fellows

### *Dr. Ran Xue*

Ran Xue received his Ph.D in Agriculture from Lanzhou University in 2017 including 2 years’ joint study in the University of Adelaide funded by CSC. During his PhD, Ran studied the interaction between microbial community and plant under water stress. He joined Bin’s lab in Jun, 2018, where he involves in “dark matter” or uncultured microbes in soil to excavate microbial resources for agriculture, manufacture and health care. Ran’s research interests also including bacteria cell size, active microorganism and microbial community assembly.


### *Dr. Xiangfeng Tan*
![](img/members/tan.jpg)

I received my PhD degree in Forest Biology and Management from the University of Alberta.  My thesis research mainly involved the roles of plant aquaporins under low oxygen conditions. I joined Dr. Ma's lab in July 2019 as a postdoc fellow, and have been studying the rhizosphere interactions between plants and microbes.  Benefiting from my backgrounds in ecology and plant science, I would like to keep expanding my research interests.

### *Dr. Erinne Stirling*
![](img/members/erinne.jpg)

Erinne Stirling completed her PhD in 2019 at The University of Adelaide, South Australia with a thesis titled ‘Nutrient cycling between litters and soil after fire in native woodland and Pinus radiata plantations’. During her PhD, Erinne also worked as a freelance researcher on a number of projects including Australia’s Emissions Reduction Scheme, the microbial ecology of Acid Sulfate Soils, and drought effects in permanently and ephemerally saturated inland hydric soils. She was extensively involved in undergraduate teaching and community outreach of soil science. Erinne joined Bin’s laboratory in December, 2019 wherein she aspires to continue working in the soil ecology research and soils education workspace. Erinne is broadly interested in many aspects of soil science, including nutrient cycling, microbial interactions, abiotic chemistry and soil taxonomy.

### *Kankan Zhao*
(co-superivsed with Prof. Jianming Xu and Prof. Philip C. Brookes)

![](img/members/zhaokankan.png)

**We are turning the tide**

Kankan Zhao decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Soil Science after graduating from Zhejiang University with a degree of Bachelor of Agricultural Science in Agricultural Resources and Environment. His primary focus lies in using ecological theories and bioinformatics methods to reveal the interactions between rhizosphere microbial community members. Currently, he is exploring to apply time series analysis to unravel microbial community dynamics. He is also interested in soil viromes. 

### *Yiling Wang*

![](img/members/wangyiling.jpg)

**Anything but ordinary**

Yiling Wang holds a Agricultural Resources and Environment B.S.A. from the Zhejiang University. She is currently working on an exploration of the viromes in soil ecosystems. During the Ph.D study, her focus lies in the viruses and their prokaryotic hosts in rice rhizosphere soils to explore the dynamic variation of viral community structure and ascertain the complex interactions between viruses and prokaryotic hosts in rice rhizosphere. Her end goal is to understand the ecological functions of viral community in paddy ecosystems, increase the knowledge in carbon biogeochemical cycle in paddy ecosystems, and provide theoretical support for regulating ecological functions of paddy ecosystems. 

### *Hengyi Dai*
(*Support by "Agronomy+X" multi-discipline centre and co-superivsed with Prof. Yu Wu*)

![](img/members/daihengyi.jpg)

Hengyi Dai holds an Agricultural Resources and Environment B.S.A. and has a minor in public administration from the Zhejiang University. He joined the BMA lab on 2019 summer and will work for his Ph.D. in Soil Science Cross Fluid Mechanics from 2020 fall.  His work focuses on the interaction of rhizosphere microorganisms based on microfluidic chips. Currently he is exploring the effects of free radicals on the activity of rice rhizosphere microbial community via microfluidics-technologies.

### *Xinwei Song*

![](img/members/xinwei.jpg)

Xinwei Song graduated from the Nanjing Agricultural University in June 2020. She majored in ecology as an undergraduate and was interested in soil microbes specifically. After she graduated, she was lucky enough to enter BMA lab and became a member of the research group. Her research project is bioremediation of soil composite pollution, and her main research content is the construction of ecological network of rhizosphere cooperative remediation of agricultural soil with combined pollution. Her final goal is to establish the rhizospheric interaction networks of plants-animals-microorganisms to accelerate the synergetic remediation of combined pollutants. Further, to find new methods to regulate the synergistic remediation in rhizosphere on combined pollutants in agricultural soils.
