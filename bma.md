### Research Interests

#### Engineering Soil Microbiome
Mining and exploiting the microbiomes have crucial application potentials in soil nutrient utilization and plant health promotion. However, there is still a woeful shortage of precise design and validation systems in soil microbial research. The proposed project will design and assemble the functions of rice rhizosphere engineering microbiomes, aiming at sustainable development of agriculture, and will employ microbial complex networks and machine learning algorithms to achieve the directed regulation of rice rhizosphere engineering microbiome functions. Addressing the above scientific questions will provide a new framework for microbiome engineering and support the sustainable development of agriculture.

#### Systems Microbiology

Microbes wired with others through complex interactions. Systems biology provides a novel perspedctive for microbial ecology investigation that interaction networks of genes, proteins, microbes, and other factors in ecosystems play critical roles in regulating ecosystem functions. We are trying to explore the complex interactions in microbial communities by inferring microbial networks for genes, proteins, and microbes.

#### Rhizosphere Microbiomes

Rhizosphere microbiomes are essential for plant grwoth and health, and for ecosystem sustainability. However, our understanding in rhizosphere microbiomes is still unclear because of microbial "dark matters" and complex cross-talking between plant and rhizosphere microbiomes. We are digging microbial "dark matters" with FACS-iChip and are illustrating plant-microbe cross-talking mechanisms in rhizosphere with RhizoChip.
