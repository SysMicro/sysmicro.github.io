## Overview

In this project, we developed the most comprehensive soil virome compilation to date with 345,607 partial viral genomes from 1,873 deeply sequenced soil metagenomes and analyzed of this dataset revealed distinct environmental impacts and regional variation.

## Dataset Download

GSV sequences can be downloaded from iVirus through [cyverse](https://data.cyverse.org/dav-anon/iplant/home/fudong0610/GSV/GSV_viralseqs_20210325.fasta). 

Other associated data supporting the findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
